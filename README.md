Title: Currency Exchange Tracker - GitHub Repository

Description:

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Currency Exchange Tracker, an advanced mobile app designed to provide users with real-time and accurate currency exchange rates. This open-source project showcases a robust implementation of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, WorkManager, and Room Database, all powered by the OpenExchange Rates API.

Key Features:

1. **MVVM Architecture:**
   Dive into the clean and organized codebase that follows the MVVM architecture, separating concerns between the data model, user interface, and business logic. This structure enhances scalability and maintainability, making it easy for developers to contribute and extend the app's functionality.

2. **WorkManager Integration:**
   Explore the efficient use of WorkManager to schedule and manage background tasks. The app utilizes WorkManager to make periodic calls to the OpenExchange Rates API every 30 minutes, ensuring up-to-date currency exchange rates while optimizing network bandwidth.

3. **OpenExchange Rates API Integration:**
   Discover the seamless integration with the OpenExchange Rates API, providing the latest and most accurate currency exchange rates. This integration ensures the reliability of the app's data, empowering users with real-time information.

4. **Room Database for Data Persistence:**
   Delve into the implementation of Room Database, a powerful SQLite-based object-mapping library. See how network responses from the OpenExchange Rates API are stored locally. This allows users to access comprehensive exchange rate information even when offline. Room Database ensures smooth synchronization between the UI and the underlying data.

5. **Test Suites:**
   - Explore Android tests that validate the app's functionality on real devices and emulators.
   - Dive into JUnit local tests that ensure the correctness of individual units of code in isolation.

6. **Contribution Opportunities:**
   Contribute to the project by enhancing existing features, fixing bugs, or suggesting new functionalities. We welcome collaboration from the open-source community to make Currency Exchange Tracker even more powerful and user-friendly.

7. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   Explore the intuitive and user-friendly interface that presents real-time currency exchange rates in a visually appealing manner. The app enables users to effortlessly navigate, view data, and make informed decisions regarding currency exchanges.

**Getting Started:**
   - Add your OpenExchange Rates API key to the local.properties file in the root of the project:
     ```
     API_ID="your_api_key"
     BASE_URL="https://openexchangerates.org/api/"
     ```
